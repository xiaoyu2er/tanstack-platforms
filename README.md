# TanStack Start Multi-Tenant Example

A production-ready example of a multi-tenant application built with TanStack Start, featuring custom subdomains for each tenant. This project is forked from Vercel's [Next.js platforms example](https://github.com/vercel/platforms) and converted to use TanStack Start.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

## Features

- âœ… Custom subdomain routing with TanStack Start
- âœ… Tenant-specific content and pages
- âœ… Shared components and layouts across tenants
- âœ… Redis for tenant data storage
- âœ… Admin interface for managing tenants
- âœ… Emoji support for tenant branding
- âœ… Support for local development with subdomains
- âœ… Compatible with Vercel preview deployments

## Tech Stack

- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) - Full-stack React framework
- [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) for data storage
- [Tailwind 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the design system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17.0 or later
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn
- Upstash Redis account (for production)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xiaoyu2er/tanstack-platforms.git
   cd tanstack-platforms
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit `.env` with your values:

   ```
   KV_REST_API_URL=your_redis_url
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_redis_token
   VITE_ROOT_DOMAIN=localhost:3000
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Main site: http://localhost:3000
   - Admin panel: http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Tenants: http://[tenant-name].localhost:3000

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

This application demonstrates a subdomain-based multi-tenant architecture where:

- Each tenant gets their own subdomain (`tenant.yourdomain.com`)
- TanStack Start routes handle subdomain detection and tenant-specific content
- Tenant data is stored in Redis using a `subdomain:{name}` key pattern
- The main domain hosts the landing page and admin interface
- Subdomains are dynamically mapped to tenant-specific content

The application intelligently detects subdomains across various environments (local development, production, and Vercel preview deployments).

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed on Vercel. To deploy:

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy

For custom domains, make sure to:

1. Add your root domain to Vercel
2. Set up a wildcard DNS record (`*.yourdomain.com`) on Vercel
